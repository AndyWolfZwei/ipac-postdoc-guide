【5-2】: This is to inform you that

- Prepare the documents proposed in【6-1】-【6-4】, scan them and upload them into the system.
- The button in this colour ![mandatory upload](images/Figure_context_stage2_5-2_1.jpg) means it is mandatory; and the button in another colour ![optional upload](images/Figure_context_stage2_5-2_2.jpg) means it is optional.
- Documents in 【7-1】-【7-2】are generated automatically by the system (according to the info you’ve filled in).
- **Please be aware that before you hit the “submit application” button in【8】, you are allowed to withdraw what you’ve uploaded or change whatever the information you’ve filled in. Once you click【8】and submit them, you cannot revise anything**.

【6-1】: Click to download the *.doc* file. It should look like *Figure 33*.

- **You only need to upload the first page of this file.**
- “who’s in charge, sign and seal”: this is about where you save your personnel files. Please find the people in charge of your personnel files, ask him/her to sign and stamp the official seal.

【**About personal profile**】In China, we have personal files/archives that record our information. When a student moves from School A (in China) to School B (also in China), his archive is transferred from A to B. If the student moves from School A (in China) to School C (say, in the U.S.), due to the different system within two countries, apparently his personal archive will not be sent to USA. Also, School A will no longer keep his files. In this case, the student has to find an authorized agency (e.g. a legal Agency D) to store his files. When he comes back from USA and again works in China, say Company E, then, the human resources department of E will take over his personal files from D.

【**For foreign applicants**】 We understand that some countries do not hold such system on personal files. For applicants from those countries, we suggest that you get a sign and a seal from the latest university/company that you worked for. In *Figure 33*, ① is the talent service center, which refers to the agency D mentioned above, ② is the organization you worked for before you come to China. You can choose either ① or ② to get a seal. The seal should come from an authorized organization, and the signature should come from a person that is in charge of it (Don't sign your own name!) . In ②, the text means that your former employer says: this person now has no employment relationship with this organization, but we temporarily preserve his archive for him.

【**Please note that**】 The *.doc* file does not have an English version. The signature and seal can be in English.
